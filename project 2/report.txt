CS 31 Project 2 Report
Notable Obstacles:
One of the notable obstacles I had to overcome was figuring out how to still output all of the remaining questions and request all of the remaining information from the user if my program detected an error in one of the users’ responses. Although this wasn’t exactly required according to the program guidelines, I wanted to make sure my program ran in the exact same way as the example provided. I was ultimately able to figure out that instead of writing each error message to “cout” as soon as it occurred, I instead created a string variable named “errorMessages” and wrote multiple else-if statements to assign different error messages to the the string “errorMessage” if the user’s input did not exactly match one of the required inputs from the project spec.


Another notable obstacle that I had to overcome was determining the calculations of the plan discounts. At first, I was confused because I initially thought that the “Type of Plan Discounts” (where children receive a 50% discount and seniors receive a 25% discount) applied towards the “Kind of Plan” cost (where Executive costs $100.00 and Basic costs $50.00). However, in running my code in CodeBoard and comparing my code’s output to the CodeBoard output, I figured out that the “Type of Plan Discounts” applied towards the “Extra Cost for Everyday Access” and “Extra Cost for Facilities Access”. After this revelation, I made the proper adjustments to my calculations for the “Type of Plan Discounts” and it passed the test cases in CodeBoard. This showed me the importance of carefully reading and understanding the project spec to the best of my knowledge and the usefulness of CodeBoard.
